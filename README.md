# U-Net-Semantic-Segmentation-A-Performance-Benchmarking-Study
I systematically analyzed how transfer learning and data augmentation affect a model's ability to reconstruct fine boundary details in urban scenes. The optimized model delivers state-of-the-art results on vehicle masking tasks with rapid convergence and robust generalization.
